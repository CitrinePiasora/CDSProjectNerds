# A Cloud Native App that Predicts What Kind of BeatMap an osu! BeatMap is!
Our cloud native app analyzes a given beatmap from the game osu! and tries to classify them into map "types" based on the data of the map. These map types will then be viewable to anyone who visit the site. This will be useful for players of the game osu! as osu!'s current site/explorer doesn't classify their maps by playstyle or contents of the beatmap. With our app, players are able to find maps based on their preferred map types and avoid maps that they don't enjoy.
